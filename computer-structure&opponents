# CPU structure
Programm Counter(PC)  or Instruction Counter
- this counter determins where the program is heading
- PC can store 'instruction address' and temporary store 'arithmetical/logical calculation result'
1. Before the program is executed, the first instruction's memory address was sent into Program Counter,
CPU will follow PC's command, reading the first instruction (Fetch instruction) 
2. when executing the instruction, CPU will rewrite the information in PC ( For instance: PC= PC +1), so that 
it can always reach the next intruction's address
3. Beacause of the mostly instruction were executed in order, the rewrite process usually runs like (PC = PC +1)
4. when it comes to a transfer instruction, the instruction result is to change the value of PC(turns to the aimed address)
5. Thus , CPU always following the PC's command, (fetching instructions, compiling code, executing) and based on it , the program
transfer was accomplished.


# Hardware
## Input/Output
- controlling ways between computer and peripherals: Process Control, Interrupt(break), DMA(Direct memory access)
- Process control: CPU executing process controls the Input/Output process
- Interrupt(break):device send CPU a "break request signal" , when CPU respond, it will stop the executing task and 
run the device's request. When it was done, CPU turns back to its work.
- DMA(direct memory access) : CPU send order to DMA controller and let it handle the Data transportation, and
send back the information to CPU( this can greatly reduce occupation of CPU and save resourses)
 
# Hardware
## accumulator register
- main part of calculator, storing calculation results
- providing a work area for ALU(arithmetic logical unit, temporary store information of the ALU calculation

# Hardware
## Bus: Data bus, Address bus, and Control bus
### Between CPU and bus
- DMA occupy bus resources, and CPU won't use bus all the time(while in a instruction cycles)
- so that DMA request's checkpoint will executed at the end of each bus period(or so called machine cycles)
### Data bus
- transport CPU data to storage or I/O.etc  (and vice versa)
- 

## VLIW:(Very Long Instruction Word) 
- a group of instructions, it links many instructions together, which speed up calculation
